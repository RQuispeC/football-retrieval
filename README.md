# Football retrieval project

basic previous steps

* Clone this repo
* Download the file shared by the professor
* Create a directory `data` and unzip data in a directory `dados_futebol`. Final `data` should look like:
  ```
  data\
    dados_futebol\
      CapBotT1Suav.2d
      CapBotT1Vel.vel
      ...
      possecorfluT2.txt
  ```

* `main.py` will control all our code
* Directory `football_lib` has the library we are going to implement
